Well, after the <a href="http://fastpagemode.blogspot.com/2007/10/they-said-half-hit-of-ecstasy-would-be.html">post that I did a few weeks ago</a> where I highlighted the Ecstasy ad that <a href="http://www.drugfreeworld.org/">drugfreeworld.org</a> put up on YouTube, I figured I would give a shot to posting a video on Wordpress to the same effect.<img src="http://nojsstats.appspot.com/UA-8591035-7/jetteroheller.wordpress.com" />

Ecstasy seems to be one of the more insidious drugs out there, as it's marketed to those who want to have fun, want to be uninhibited on the <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH2_2.HTM">2nd dynamic</a>, and don't really care about the consequences of their actions.  Try browsing around a pro-ecstasy forum sometime -- the mindset is just utterly bizarre and something I have a hard time understanding.
