      I <a href="http://fastpagemode.blogspot.com/2006/10/what-sort-of-technology-does-india.html">wrote an article a few days ago on India</a>, as that is a country that just plain intrigues me with the number of able people interspersed with extreme poverty and disorganization.  It's something that honestly does seem like an ideal candidate for Mr. Hubbard's management technology, as detailed by <a href="http://www.scientologytoday.org/corp/rtc2.htm" title="David Miscavige">Mr. David Miscavige</a> in his <a href="http://www.rtc.org/en_US/presentations/thisisscientology.html" title="David Miscavige"><em>This is Scientology</em></a> presentation.    It's something that with a little application of <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH17_2.HTM" title="Scientology Organizational Technology">basic organizational technology</a>, and a few ideal <a href="http://www.scientologytoday.org/around-the-world/index.htm" title="Churches of Scientology">Churches of Scientology</a> in the area, an immense change in the scene could be effected.

However, change gears to a location like Kaohsiung in Taiwan, and you get a fully different scene than that in India.  Taiwan is the product of a strong-willed, exceptionally productive people not wanting to live under communist rule, and as such living under constant <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH11_3.HTM">suppression</a> from threats of military action or the simple suppression that comes about through countries not even willing to recognize you as a sovereign state.

Despite this, however, you have a place like Kaohsiung, which is now the 3rd-largest seaport in the world, and has some of the <a href="http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=122136">tallest buildings and beautiful downtown areas</a> of anywhere in Asia.  So, what are they missing in terms of technology?  In this case, I would be hard-pressed to say it has anything to do with their ability to build tall buildings or printed circuit boards.

I would submit that it's instead things like the <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH11.HTM">technology of overcoming suppression</a> - which <u>individuals</u><em> </em>in that country need just as much as the country as a whole.  It's things like the <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH12.HTM">technology of dealing with a seemingly dangerous environment</a>, and how to stay sane and causative in a world that the media makes seem dangerous.  It's also what inspired me to write this on Taiwan -- the technology of how to <a href="http://www.scientologytoday.org/press/610052356581_scn-local.html">stop drug abuse</a> before it starts -- education.

With items like that to help the individual, I would have to say Taiwan could be made a better place to live.
