Ron Hubbard said in the book, <i><a href="http://jetteroheller.fsm.org/items/pow.html">The Problems of Work</a>:</i>

<b>“One begins to feel after he has been long on a job, has been considerably abused on that job, that to work any more would be quite beyond his endurance.  He is tired. The thought of doing certain things makes him tired.  He thinks of raising his energy or of being able to force his way along just a little bit further.  And if he does so, he is thinking in the wrong channels, since the answer to exhaustion has little, if anything, to do with energy.”</b>  — LRH

(and if you find yourself in this position, with no energy, you should actually read this book. You can pick it up <a href="http://jetteroheller.fsm.org/items/pow.html">here</a>.)

Well, one solution to this is to get out a bit and see something else besides the computer screen.  So, at 7am this morning, here's where I found myself -- on the road on a nice little bike ride.

Figured I'd share a few of the photos with you:

Looking down at the building housing the <a href="http://www.scientologytoday.org/">Church of Scientology International</a>, in Hollywood, CA. This is taken from the same position as the later photo in this series looking down at this building -- but this time with my .42x wide angle lens strapped on.

Looking down at the building housing the <a href="http://www.scientologytoday.org/">Church of Scientology International</a>, in Hollywood, CA. This is taken with the 380mm lens on my Minolta zoomed all the way in, no tripod.

Looking down from the Griffith Park observatory at downtown L.A. (background) and the <a href="http://www.scientology-losangeles.org/">Church of Scientology of Los Angeles</a> and <a href="http://www.bridgepub.com">Bridge Publications</a> (slightly closer).
