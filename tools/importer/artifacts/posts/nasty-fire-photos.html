      <p>Jan's blog has some horrible fire photos that sort of took me aback: </p>

<H4 class="TextColor1">Get real:  Sobering Images of Fires in Australia</H4><DIV>It doesn’t appear it’s totally real to some people the actual
disaster that is happening down in Victoria Australia, and what it actually means to
have whole portions of countryside torched and people’s livelihood
vaporised by a rolling brushfire that takes out anything in its path.  
<p><img width="400" height="300" src="http://modrich.homeip.net/gallery2/d/3525-3/IMGP0330.JPG" alt="Fire front near Dargo (Howitville)" longdesc="This image shows the fire front near Dargo (Howitville) during the week leading up to Christmas (photographer unknown)" /></p>

</DIV><br>
<p>That's one place I don't want to be.  ...As a spectator anyway.  Again, I restate -- I have no idea how one goes about handling such a fire.  It's such a complete disaster, that there must be some technology for this that average humans are missing.  It can't be that we don't have the resources to put out a forest fire, now that we've been fighting them for however many years. </p>

<p>Either that, or we only posess the technology for starting fires, and lack the developed techniques for putting them out.  Just look at the trouble we're having trying to convice Iran <i>not</i> to have an atom bomb. <br>
</p>

<p>Enough said, I guess. <br>
</p>

<p>All I know is that the Firemen, the <a href="http://www.redcross.org">Red Cross</a> on the ground, the <a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/">Volunteer Ministers</a>, and anyone else who's lent a hand down there, are total heroes who will probably have a movie made about them later by the spectators back here in the states.  Hats off to you. <br>
