Take one phrase, such as Googling for "common cold" in various languages:

<strong>Japanese:</strong>

Googling for "感冒" in google.jp gives you 2 results in the top 10 that directly link to Japanese characters in the URL itself (which will of course be rewritten in the browser), and 3 of the top 4 had the phrase in Japanese chars in the title, all of them in the snippet.

Interestingly, the #1 result has a decoded UTF-8 version of the characters as the URL:

<strong>d.hatena.ne.jp/keyword/%B4%B6%CB%C1</strong>

<strong>Russian:</strong>

Googling for "простудой" in google.ru gives you zero results that have Russian characters in the first 3 pages of results.  Most are CMS-driven sites that have letters &amp; numbers in the URLs themselves.

All of the top 10 results, though, have the keyword in Russian chars in the subject and most have it in the snippet as well.

<strong>Greek:</strong>

Similar to Russian, most of the top 10 results for "κοινο κρυολογημα" are CMS-type sites with the keyword in the title and description, but no keyword or transliteration of the keyword apparent in the URL itself.

<strong></strong>

<strong>German: </strong>

The word I have for <em>common cold</em> in German is "Erkältung".  May not be right, but it serves me well as it has an a(umlaut) in the spelling.

Googling for this in Google.de gives a <strong>very</strong> interesting result.  The number 1 result, a Wikipedia entry, is for <strong><a href="http://jetteroheller.wordpress.com/wp-admin/de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erkältung">de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erkältung</a></strong> -- with the a(umlaut) in the display URL.   The #4 result has this as well -- <a href="http://www.gesundheitpro.de/Erkältung">www.gesundheitpro.de/<strong>Erkältung</strong></a>.

However, the #3, #5,  and #10 results utilize the transliterated "ae" spelling in the title - <a href="http://www.erkaeltung-online.de">www.<strong>erkaeltung</strong>-online.de</a> and  <a href="http://www.netdoktor.de/krankheiten/fakta/erkaeltung.htm">www.netdoktor.de/krankheiten/fakta/<strong>erkaeltung</strong>.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.aspirin.de/erkaeltung/index.html">www.aspirin.de/<strong>erkaeltung</strong>/index.html</a> -- which leads one to believe that it's just as effective, in the European languages, to use the transliterated version of these characters in SEO-sensitive elements like the filename, title and description.

I'm not sure which conclusions this draws me to, but it's data.  Anyone have insight or suggestions?
