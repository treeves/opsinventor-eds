</p><p class="flickr-yourcomment"> 	A tsunami caused by an undersea earthquake just off the coast of the Solomon Islands is mobilizing Scientology Volunteer Ministers from the Australia - New Zealand - Oceania area to help in disaster relief efforts.</p>
Donations are needed for this, and are being accepted on the <a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/">Scientology VM</a> site.

From an <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/quake_and_tsunami_kill_13_countless_are_missing">article on the recent tsunami</a>:

Gizo resident Judith Kennedy said water "right up to your head" swept through the town.

"All the houses near the sea were flattened," she told The Associated Press by telephone. "The downtown area is a very big mess from the tsunami and the earthquake," she added. "A lot of houses have collapsed. The whole town is still shaking" from aftershocks.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured magnitude-8.0 and struck at 7:39 a.m. about 6 miles beneath the sea floor, 217 miles northwest of the capital, Honiara.

The Pacific region from Australia to Hawaii went on high alert for several hours after the quake struck between the islands of Bougainville and New Georgia.

Gizo, a regional center, is just 25 miles from the earthquake's epicenter.

Anyone who's ever wanted to <a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/train/">train as a Scientology Volunteer Minister</a> is now encouraged to go to the Scientology VM site and let them know you want to help.
