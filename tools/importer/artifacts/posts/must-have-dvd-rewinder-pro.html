I don't know about you, but I just hate rewinding my DVDs manually after watching them. Thank goodness someone came up with the <a href="http://www.dvdrewinder.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1&amp;zenid=0876278cefe81c7fa7f754cd4568b416">DVD rewinder</a> to relieve my tired hands. Just snap the disc on top, press the button and watch in wonder as your disc spins up thanks to the "Centriptal Velocity Spindle." It even has its own rewinding sound which if you don't like, can be re-recorded. Show this to your less-technical friends, sit back and enjoy the show. Batteries not included and yes, this thing <strong>is real</strong> and can be purchased.

And, with a special add-on pack, it will even rewind CD's too!
