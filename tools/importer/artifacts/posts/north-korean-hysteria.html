      If you check all over the news right now, you'll just see tons and tons of items all about the unconfirmed nuclear test that North Korea has just performed.  First off, it's unconfirmed, yet it's being blared all over the place anyway.  Second, it's just one more item to make people feel scared and afraid and feel like the environment is extremely dangerous and you need to hide.

Well, the technology you need to apply at this point is from the <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/LESSEN.HTM"><em>Solutions for a Dangerous Environment</em></a> booklet from the <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/" title="Scientology"><em>Scientology Handbook</em></a>.   In fact, don't read any further from here.  Just click on the link above and check it out -- it could save you a ton of trouble today.
