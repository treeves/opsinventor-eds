      My main system right now is back on Linux.  Fedora 7 came out, and I couldn't resist.  Being on Windows was starting to get on my nerves.
Being as it's been a few months, I decided to see if any headway had been made on getting Dreamweaver running on Linux.  Dreamweaver CS3 is out, Apollo is threatening to change all our lives, and make a Flash-based operating system, and figured this was just the time for someone to make a big breakthrough and decide to port Dreamweaver to Linux.

So, I went and typed in "<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=dreamweaver+linux&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2">dreamweaver linux</a>" into my handy Flock browser, and lo and behold - the first result was a great article on <a href="http://fastpagemode.blogspot.com/2006/12/using-dreamweaver-on-linux.html">Dreamweaver on Linux</a>!  I'm saved!

However, much to my dismay, my hopes were quickly dashed.  The article I came up with on that #1 result was an article <strong>I wrote</strong> and posted in my <a href="http://www.scientologyreligion.org/">Scientology</a> Network Engineer Blog several months ago about open-source alternatives to Dreamweaver, and how all such alternatives just don't add up to the real deal.

Argh!

It still befuddles me, in that Linux is the ideal web development platform, all except for the fact that you can't natively run the ideal web development tool.  My copy of Dreamweaver that I own is MX 2004, so it won't even run on Crossover Office or WINE.  <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=7694">Dreamweaver CS3 also is verified to NOT work via WINE</a>.

So, I'm once again, back to Quanta.

Please, any suggestions would be mighty helpful.
