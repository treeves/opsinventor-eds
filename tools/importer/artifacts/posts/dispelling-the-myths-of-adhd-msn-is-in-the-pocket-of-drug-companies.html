      <blockquote cite="http://health.msn.com/centers/adhd/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100143851&amp;GT1=8762">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a medical condition that affects more than 15 million Americans. Its symptoms -- including distractibility, impulsivity and hyperactivity -- can seriously interfere with a person's ability to function from day to day. With the right support and treatment, children and adults with ADHD often lead successful lives. <strong>Plenty of ADHD naysayers, however, don't recognize the condition. </strong>Become an activist and the next time you encounter a skeptic, provide him or her with some fast facts. Below is the truth about ADHD -- use it to dispel common myths and misconceptions.</blockquote><p class="citation"><cite><a href="http://health.msn.com/centers/adhd/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100143851&amp;GT1=8762">Dispelling the Myths of ADHD - ADHD - MSN Health &amp; Fitness</a></cite></p>

<p><p>Once again, MSN publishes an <strong>utterly</strong>, unabashedly bought-out article on ADHD.  <p>A major cash cow for multitudinous drug companies, ADHD is a completely manufactured disease which was cooked up and voted upon by psychiatrists so as to basically save the psychiatric profession.  Now, articles like this are obviously paid for (look at the ad on the page) and pushed forward by drug companies to lend credibility to their statements. <br>
</p>

<p>I wouldn't get so mad about if it weren't such a bald-faced, complete lie.  Come now.  If I have a hard time studying math, it's because I'm chemically imbalanced?  If I always want to go out and climb mountains, it's because I have a ritalin deficiency?  <br>
</p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://www.cchr.org/">CCHR.org</a> and get the <a href="http://www.cchr.org/shop/shopdisplayproducts_dvd.asp">documentary on Psychiatry</a>.  Instead of cooked up, drug-company-sponsored platitudes, one should get some actual, documented, hard facts straight out of the mouths of the psychiatrists who support this. <br>
