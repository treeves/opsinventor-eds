      [digg=http://www.digg.com/security/Human_Rights_Sites_Censored_in_China/]It's very common knowledge that Internet Access in China is quite censored.  I never knew exactly how much, but always found it heartening when I found a Chinese person stumbling upon a <a href="http://www.scientologytoday.org/">Scientology</a>-related blog of mine, etc -- as I never know what content of mine is going to be deemed "subversive" to the Chinese government.  Now, you can check such things on <a href="http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/test/">http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/test/</a> - a site that tries to pull your website down from a server in China, and can tell if it's blocked or not.

Called the <em>Golden Shield Project</em> (which you can get details on from Answers.com) the filter does quite a bit of work to filter your content.

Now, on <a href="http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/test/">this site</a>, I tested a few URL's, just for curiosity.  The first one that I would have thought would have been blocked is <a href="http://www.freedommag.org/" title="Scientology's Freedom Magazine">http://www.freedommag.org</a> - the <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/">Scientology</a> publication most outspoken about psychiatry and various human rights abuses.  However, this one went through just fine.  The <a href="http://www.cchr.org/">CCHR website</a> (also very loudly outspoken about psychiatry) also went through.  I guess the Chinese government has no trouble with slamming psychiatry!   The <a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/">Scientology Volunteer Ministers site</a>, also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scientology/421260332/" title="Scientology VM site is OK">went through without a hitch</a>.
Now, on the other hand, the <a href="http://www.youthforhumanrights.org/">www.youthforhumanrights.org</a>, a site with some phenomenal public service announcements made to educate people on basic Human Rights, is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scientology/421260413/in/photostream/" title="YHRI site blocked">most assuredly BLOCKED</a>.  I guess they consider that as "subversive".  Likewise, L. Ron Hubbard's common-sense moral code, "<a href="http://www.twth.org/">The Way to Happiness</a>" is completely blocked.  This is no doubt due to the precept in <em>The Way to Happiness</em> of '<em>Support a Government Designed and Run for <u>All</u> the People</em>'.  Probably not what they're looking for.

Sure, there's no problem whatever filtering out pornography, etc., but filtering out a moral code which has single-handedly stopped wars and gotten people back together, and has saved nations -- that doesn't seem like a great idea to me.

Comments are very welcome on this one.
