The article states:

<em>"Federal investigators are looking into patient care at the hospital made famous in the movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," where there have been reports of abuse, short staffing and overcrowding.</em>

<em>The Oregon State Hospital is one of the oldest and most dilapidated state mental institutions in the nation. The movie was filmed there in 1975.</em>

<em>Justice Department officials are expected to visit the hospital next week. The department alerted Gov. Ted Kulongoski in June that it would investigate whether patients' constitutional rights were violated.</em>

<em>The facility is at the center of discussions about reforming mental health care in Oregon. Reports of abuse and other problems led lawmakers to reassess the hospital's future.</em>

<em>Lawmakers have proposed replacing it with two separate hospitals and two residential facilities at an estimated cost of at least <strong>$324 million</strong>.  It's unclear how long the investigation could take. Justice Department spokeswoman Cynthia Magnuson said she could not discuss the timeline or details of the investigation."</em>

I used to drive by this place regularly when I worked in Oregon, and it is one of those places where you feel like you need to take a shower after you drive by.  It's creepy and gives one the chills.

The investigation itself isn't totally surprising, seeing as though hundreds of such psychiatric hospitals have been similarly investigated, and shut down.  You honestly can't operate a business whereby you pretend to be official and cure people, and then do nothing but <a href="http://www.cchr.org/index.cfm/6636">shock</a>, drug, and torture them.  It doesn't really work.
