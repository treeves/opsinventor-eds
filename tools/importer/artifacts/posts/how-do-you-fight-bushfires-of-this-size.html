bushfires burning in Gippsland and Victoria's north-east are believed
to have joined overnight, forming one massive firefront.</p>

<p>The head of the blaze is estimated to span 240km in length.</p>

<p>Together the bushfires have scorched about 250,000 hectares and continue to burn out of control.</p>

<p>There has got to be a more established technology for dealing with such things, as brushfires seem to be something that one could easily develop a workable tactic to handle quickly -- without it having to envelop half a state.   Anyone know the answer to such?<br>
