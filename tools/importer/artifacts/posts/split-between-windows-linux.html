      <p>If you read the comments on the <a href="http://www.digg.com/microsoft/Vista_user_on_hold_6_hrs_to_activate_says_screw_it_I_m_back_to_Linux">Digg post I put on this Windows Vista activation fiasco</a>, it appears some people thought I was just trying to stir up the Linux/MS thing for Digg publicity.&nbsp; Well, wish it was the reason I spent 6.5 hours on hold, but unfortunately I generally have better things to do with my life than be on hold waiting to activate my operating system.&nbsp; Anyhow, fine -- I ended up keeping my FC6 box for sysadmin stuff that is just better on Linux, and fired up XP Pro on my new Core2 box.&nbsp; As I'm doing a lot of training on folks now, I need to know what the usual Windows user sees - so fine, XP it is.&nbsp; </p> <p>That also means I can keep writing with LiveWriter, which still is the best reason I've found to stick with Windows.&nbsp; It is right now the Ultimate Blogging machine.&nbsp; </p> <p>See, check this out.&nbsp; Let's say I'm doing one of my regular stories like I do with my other blog on <a href="http://orgsaroundtheworld.wordpress.com/">orgsaroundtheworld.wordpress.com</a> -- showing off some gorgeous, restored <a href="http://www.scientologytoday.org/">Scientology</a> building somewhere in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take <a href="http://www.scientology-buffalo.org/">Scientology in Buffalo</a>, NY for example.</p> <p>Well,&nbsp;with a swift keystroke, I can fire in a map of the area from MS Live Maps: </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="display:inline;margin:0;padding:0;"><a href="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=42.8969~-78.87077&amp;lvl=1&amp;style=o&amp;scene=584535" id="map-a05438a0-688e-4055-ac83-d9f6817cd7b6" title="Click to view this map on Live.com"><img src="http://www.jetteroheller.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/windowslivewritersplitbetweenwindowslinux-1035fmap14da9158578f1.jpg" width="320" height="240"></a></div></p> <p>Blammo.&nbsp; Bird's eye view.&nbsp; Not the most flattering view of the building, but still pretty slick.&nbsp; If you don't like it, though, you can rotate it.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="display:inline;margin:0;padding:0;"><a href="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=42.89638~-78.87115&amp;lvl=1&amp;style=o&amp;scene=584428" id="map-b4a53b42-6f58-4b2b-924f-ed2afe9bf5f0" title="Click to view this map on Live.com"><img src="http://www.jetteroheller.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/windowslivewritersplitbetweenwindowslinux-1035fmapab26fa157a40.jpg" width="320" height="240"></a></div></p> <p>I'm not a usual one to be a Microsoft proponent, but seriously -- that is one of the coolest applications for blogging I've ever seen.&nbsp; </p>
