      <p></p> <p>I just commented on a post I saw on <a href="http://thegooddemocrat.wordpress.com/2007/04/17/cho-seung-hui-you-caused-me-to-do-this/">The Good Democrat</a>, regarding Cho Seung-Hui.&nbsp; A ton of comments on this post centered around the whole gun-control issue, which honestly could not be further from the point in this case.  <p>Gun control honestly isn't the problem which, if addressed, would open the door to a handling (<a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/aboutpgm/solutions/resolving_situations.html">known in investigation circles as a "Wrong Why"</a>) - just as much as curbing people's ability to buy cars would stop them from being involved in a car accident.&nbsp;<br> <br>A few things are at hand right now, though: <p>a) There are some extremely distraught, grieving people there in Blacksburg who need some help.&nbsp; There are simple things that anyone can do which can help in situations such as this, outlined on the <a title="Assists for Virginia Tech" href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/news/articles/29.html">Volunteer Ministers website</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people would like to comment and spectate on things like this, but there's honestly things that the average person can do which will help.&nbsp; Don't know if you've ever had anyone shot or killed around you, but it tends to make one very disturbed and&nbsp; upset.&nbsp; You can help with this.&nbsp; <br><br>b) <a href="http://cchr.org/index.cfm/9027/19846">Cho Seung-Hui was on psychiatric drugs</a>.&nbsp; Every other school shooting incident to date involved a kid who had been put on psychiatric drugs and then wigged out.&nbsp; See&nbsp;the <a title="Cho Seung-Hui" href="http://cchr.org/index.cfm/9027/19846">facts on the kids involved here</a>&nbsp; - it's fully documented.&nbsp; <br>Now, reason I bring up (b) is that psychiatrists are there on the ground right now, trying to give people antidepressants to calm them down, right after a drugged madman shot up the school.&nbsp; It is going to do nothing for the grief these people are feeling right now, and will instead drug them and make them potential candidates for the next mishap.&nbsp; Drugs are NOT the answer. <br><br><img height="142" alt="Scientology Volunteer Ministers - A Global Force" src="http://www.volunteerministers.org/images/aboutpgm/Cause-of-Suppression.jpg" width="240" align="right">So, if you know anyone at VT - make sure they stay off drugs, and use something more conventional - like a <em><a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/aboutpgm/solutions/overcoming_suppression.html">good friend</a></em>, so as to get through this and then get back to life.  <p>There are Salvation Army and Volunteer Ministers on the ground right now, and they need help, and they will give help.&nbsp; So whichever boat you're in, <a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/contact/form/contact.html?filter=(%26(|(o=dcd)))">you can contact them</a>.  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/contact/">Scientology Volunteer Ministers Hotline</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/locate/ui/app.html#menubar">Volunteer Ministers locator</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/news/articles/29.html">Learn how to Help in Times of Need</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/contact/form/contact.html?filter=(%26(|(o=dcd)))">Volunteer Ministers in DC (contact point for VT incident)</a></li></ul>
