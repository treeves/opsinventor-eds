I've been an AMD fan for close to 10 years now, so I've been eagerly awaiting the release of the new native <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/AMD+Unveils+Barcelona+Architecture/article6299.htm">quad-core Opterons</a> (or, really, the quad-core Phenoms!)  Now, they're out.   For those who are so inclined, check out this <a href="http://images.dailytech.com/nimage/5918_4909_large_phenom.jpg">hi-resolution die shot of the AMD Barcelona chip</a>.

My favorite hardware review site, anandtech.com, just released a <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/IT/showdoc.aspx?i=3091&amp;p=13">review of the new Opteron 2350</a>, running some of the major server-type software, as compared to the Xeon 5160 and the Xeon E5350.

It looks like the <a href="http://jetteroheller.wordpress.com/2007/03/09/3ds-max-9-on-windows-vista/">3DS Max Vista</a> performance of the new Opteron is still trailing the Xeon E5350, but for everything else - clock-for-clock - AMD is once again in the lead.   SQL server, Java server, everything else - a 2.0Ghz quad-core Opteron can soundly handle just about anything from Intel, and at less money.

Makes me wonder what would happen if I were to put a pair of them into one of these <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/x64/x2200/">Sun x2200's</a> that I have sitting in the data center.  There's a lot of work one could get done with 8 fast cores in a box like that.

So, all of the naysayers who said AMD was finished can be soundly trumped by a few good benchmarks proving the absolute reverse.
