      <p>I just got the following message when downloading a new Windows Media Encoder:<a href="http://www.jetteroheller.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/image.png"><img style="border-width:0;" height="349" alt="image" src="http://www.jetteroheller.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/image-thumb.png" width="504"/></a></p> <p>"Some downloads are made available only after users have validated their versions of Microsoft Windows. Firefox and Netscape Navigator browser users may install a helper program, the Windows Genuine Advantage plug-in, <strong>to enhance their download experience.</strong>"</p> <p>I'm not sure precisely what this means.&nbsp; I think that the inference is that when you can download the software, it enhances the experience - more so than if you're prevented from doing so. </p> <p>Personally, I think the whole WGA ("<em>Windows Genuine Advantage</em>") issue is a enormous framework and hassle trying to solve the absolutely wrong problem.&nbsp; It's the same thing as DRM and all of the woes that befall anyone trying to live with DRM-based music.&nbsp; It ends up being more hassle than it's worth. </p> <p><a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/">Scientology</a> founder <a href="http://www.lronhubbard.org/">L. Ron Hubbard</a> had a much more simple solution.&nbsp; He wrote it in <em><a href="http://www.twth.org/">The Way to Happiness</a></em>, and it's called "Seek to Live with the Truth" and "Don't Do Anything Illegal".&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp; </p><br /><a href="http://www.twth.org/video/player.html">Click here to view other Public Service Announcements</a>  <p>If you've really bought something, just be truthful about it, and don't tell harmful lies.&nbsp; The simplicity of just having and following a moral code like this is more powerful than any DRM solution there could be.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href="http://www.twth.org/video/player.html">Click here to view other Public Service Announcements</a>  <p> Likewise, it just doesn't pay to steal.&nbsp; You can tell people that, or you can educate them on it using an easy text like <em>The Way to Happiness</em>.&nbsp; </p> <p>This is the reason why you have big banks, insurance companies, hospitals, credit card companies, etc all getting and distributing TWTH to all of their customers.&nbsp; You can harp at someone to be good, you can make it really uncomfortable and inconvenient for them to be bad, but in the end -- if you target the actual problem, which is declining moral values in society, you'll have ended up making a positive change.&nbsp; As opposed to more digital rights management, more restrictions, more whack solutions to try to make it more and more difficult to pirate software, etc.&nbsp; All you end up getting there, in Microsoft's case, is people moving over to Linux because they can't stand the hassle. </p> <p>It's the same in the music industry, and look <a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9811410-7.html?tag=nefd.blgs">what's happening with the DRM trend</a>.&nbsp; People are fed up with it. </p> <p>So, let's try to buck the trend a bit and actually attack the heart of the problem.&nbsp; Sure, it's way bigger of a subject to tackle (the international decline in moral values) but in the end it will end up solving way more than just my download of Windows Media 9 encoder.&nbsp; That's for sure. </p>
