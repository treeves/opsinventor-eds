      [digg=http://www.digg.com/software/What_3DS_Max_9_doesn_t_work_on_Vista]I just got a pair of brilliant new Gateway AMD Athlon64 5200+ machines for 3DS Max.  They came pre-installed with Windows Vista Home Premium, so I thought it a great time to try out Windows Vista.

Of course, I install 3DS Max 9 as the first app.  However, I go to run the thing and I get nothing but a big, fat error.  Apparently, 3D Studio Max does not run on Windows Vista.  That's what it says on the <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=5972446">Autodesk site</a>, that's what it says on <a href="http://www.maxforums.org/thread.aspx?tid=423996">Maxforums,</a> and that's what I'm seeing in real life.  Don't see a patch for it either.

Anyone have a clue here?  Know when they're going to be doing something about this?  A bit odd that the OS that the blasted planet (unfortunately) is going to be using doesn't work with 3DS.

Now I REALLY wish it worked on Linux.
