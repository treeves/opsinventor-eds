      I just saw that we've got some nifty statistics on these Wordpress blogs - something that Eponym.com did not have.  As noted earlier, I started this blog simply so that I could try out this Netscape plugin (which I've still not gotten working), but the stats definitely has me sold as I'm a sucker for stats.

Ever since I learned about <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH17_2.HTM">Statistics management</a> from a course I took at my Church of <a href="http://www.scientologyreligion.org">Scientology,</a> I found statistics of nearly any sort absolutely riveting.  Statistics arent just numbers - they have meaning, and in themselves are an incredible analysis tool which can give one a course of action.  The <a href="http://www.wise.org">World Institute of Scientology Enterprises</a> has whole courses of study just on management by statistics.  It removes the whole idea of management by opinion.  One can then <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH17_3.HTM">plan and program</a> out handlings for things, whereas before there may just have been confusion.

Anyhow, I just wanted to put in that plug, seeing as though websites are probably the most core area where one has to grab hold of a statistics program like <a href="http://www.webtrends.com">WebTrends </a>or HBX and dig in to stats -- as if you're running anything more major than, say, a blog - you need to be able to know precisely what's going on, and then be able to formulate a course of action as a result.
