      Ran across a gnarly little social bookmarking application today.  Called <a href="http://clipclip.org/turbotad" title="ClipClip - Turbotad's Clips">ClipClip</a>, it allows you to clip out pieces of web pages an post them in related threads about a particular subject.  It saves HTML and images, as well as categories, and makes it quite easy to share a whole concept, as opposed to just linking to it.

For example, as you can see from previous posts and so forth, I've tried to get across the technology available in <a href="http://www.scientologyreligion.org">Scientology</a> on the <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org" title="Scientology">Scientology Handbook</a> website.  Now, I can add links to pages I think are useful, but still - it's a bit clumsy if you - the browser, have to wade through all my links and so forth.

However, just try going to <a href="http://clipclip.org">ClipClip</a> an typing, "Get Help" in the box of actions to do.  It will pull up a whole sequence of links I put together on the subject, which makes it easy to use these web resources to actually <b>do</b> something.

Just one more way one could use social bookmarking tools to help communicate on a topic - especially one which should be communicated about.
