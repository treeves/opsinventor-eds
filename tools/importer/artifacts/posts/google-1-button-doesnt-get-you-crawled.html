      I was doing some testing this morning with the new Google +1 button.   One of my first tests was to see if Google immediately did anything with a +1 vote, and oddly, the answer is no.

As a test, I used my <a href="http://www.scientologyparent.com/forums/">forum on the Scientology Parent site</a>.  I already know that when I make a new forum post, nobody spiders the article until I do something to make the article get seen.

I then pressed a +1 button that I just added to the article.   No effect at all.

I then posted the article to Twitter via a bit.ly link.  Not surprisingly, that <strong>immediately</strong> resulted in no less than 13 different bots crawling the article before the first real user hit it.  Only then did Google's spider crawl the link.

Curious.  Just a note.  I know they say that you don't get crawled any faster with the +1 button, but just wanted to check.
