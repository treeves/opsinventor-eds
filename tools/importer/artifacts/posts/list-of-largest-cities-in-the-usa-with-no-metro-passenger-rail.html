      <strong>Updated May 2019: </strong>Having lived &amp; worked in some of the best cities in the USA for transit (Portland, OR, Boston, DC, New York, Chicago, SF Bay) as well as some of the worst (LA, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Tampa Bay), there really is no question about how the availability of alternatives to driving on roads affects one's quality of life in the city.

However, I never cease to be amazed at those cities that are transit-deprived who run vehement anti-transit PR campaigns, attempting to convince folks that they shouldn't fund transit projects.

So, as a counterpoint to this, I've compiled a list of the 10  largest cities in the USA  with no Metro system of any sort - where your only option getting to work is either (a) sitting in your car in traffic, or (b) sitting in a bus that's sitting in the same traffic as your car would be.

<strong>Worst offender: Tampa </strong>Far and away the largest metro area with no rail is the Tampa Bay area in Florida.  Tampa-St. Pete-Clearwater is a sprawling metropolis with over 3 million people, which jumps to 4 million if you include the Sarasota area.

The fact of the Tampa area being so car-centric has repeatedly landed Tampa on the <a href="http://www.attorneybrianwhite.com/cyclists-beware-10-statistically-fatal-bicycling-routes-in-the-u-s.php">#1 list for the most bicycle deaths per-capita in the USA</a>, and is one of the <a href="https://www.welovecycling.com/wide/2017/01/27/top-10-worst-cities-cycling/">most dangerous cities for cyclists in the WORLD</a>.

Attempts at building any form of transit system have repeatedly failed.   <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2017/data/public-transportation-worst/">This article is a FANTASTIC read</a>, with some extremely telling maps and graphics that describe just how dire the situation is.

Some of the most-telling maps from the article above:

[gallery ids="968,969,970"]

So, without further ado, the list of largest US cities without rail transit:

<strong>
Note</strong>: Updating this for November 2018, as there are a few cities previously on the list when I first wrote this (Detroit, Kansas City, Cincinnati, Orlando) that have rolled out rail transit services for commuters.   I'm striking from this list any city that does now have an option for transit that doesn't involve getting gridlocked into the rest of the city's road infrastructure.  So, light rail, streetcar and commuter rail count.

Recently Stricken from the List:  (i.e. cities which now have passenger rail options for commuters)
