October 4th is <a href="https://www.imba.com/kids">International Take a Kid Mountain Biking Day</a>!   The International Mountain Biking Association sponsors events all around the world to celebrate the day &amp; introduce youth to the outdoors through mountain biking.   Their goal, a rather respectable one, is:
<blockquote>Besides being good, healthy fun, the goal is to develop a connection between kids and the natural world around them. Today's children are tomorrow's land managers and politicians — future decision-makers for important matters like recreation and access to public lands. How different might our current access landscape look today if previous generations of policy makers had grown up riding bikes on natural-surface trails?</blockquote>
My kids, 3 &amp; 5, are already die-hard trail riders, and I find it immensely gratifying that we've been able to get them connected with nature and the outdoors through mountain biking.
