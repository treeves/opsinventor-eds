However, one of my favourite services, <a href="http://www.shadows.com/users/jetteroheller/" title="Shadows on Scientology">Shadows.com</a>, seems to have suffered from CSMS (catastrophic server meltdown syndrome), which has GCRED (gigantic confusing random exception disorder) as one of its first symptoms.

Over the past 2 days, going to the home page or any sub-page of Shadows.com has resulted in only a big, gnarly exception all over my screen, and not too much useful content.  It's not my user account (as from my Fedora Core 6 box and my Windows box it's all the same) so I'm guessing there are some machines there with flames blasting out the back of the power supplies.

Unfortunate, because I really like Shadows.  I find it's a neat place to post things and organize things.  I put all of my favourite news stories there, with little notes on what I liked in them, cross linked to other various topics.  Hopefully <em>somebody</em> else also finds this useful, as that's the whole purpose of human-indexed content -- that someone has typed in some keywords that have to do with a page, and as a result you search for something and get relevant results as opposed to some other crazy thing that doesn't have to do with what you're searching.

I guess I'll use something else like my <a href="http://www.kaboodle.com/jetteroheller" title="Scientology on Kaboodle">Kaboodle page on Scientology</a> or something of the sort in the interim.  Anyone else have any light they can shed on the matter?
