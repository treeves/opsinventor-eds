      <p><a href="http://www.flock.com/" title="The Social Web Browser."><img border="0" align="right" alt="The Social Web Browser." src="http://www.flock.com/themes/flock/images/logo3.jpg" /></a>As I mentioned in my previous post, my main system is now back on Linux.  I've also switched my primary browsing back to Flock (was using IE7 and Firfox on my XP and Vista boxes).  The main thing I love about Flock is how simple and fast it is to blog about something.  You're just cruising along, see something interesting, and just - wham - ctrl+b and you're blogging. </p>

<p>I don't know if anyone noticed my absence, but pretty much the week or so when <a href="http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/index.html">Scientology</a> was getting a whole bunch of publicity in mid-May due to that <a href="http://www.freedommag.org/">yellow journalist Sweeney</a>, somehow forgot about my blogs and was just clicking off on various other things like Digg and Reddit and so forth.  Blogging on my XP machine was a matter of opening up my /wp-admin/ page and logging in and blah blah and it just wasn't as conducive to the spur-of-the-moment blog. </p>

<p>Now, I'm sure there are tools that are okay at this in Windows too, but combined with how in-love I am with my bouncy-window Compiz desktop on Fedora, I'm just glad to be back.   I just think that as soon as Apollo is released on Linux, this desktop is going to take over the world. <br>
