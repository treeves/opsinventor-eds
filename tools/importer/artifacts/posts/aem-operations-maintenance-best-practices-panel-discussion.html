<p>Following on the success of our <a href="http://www.jetteroheller.com/panel-discussion-on-aem-as-a-cloud-service/">last panel discussion</a> on AEM's cloud future, I got the chance to moderate a panel discussion on AEM devops &amp; maintenance best practices courtesy of Adobe Global Community.  </p>



<p>The discussion was held on 28 July, and I've now got the replay up and available here: </p>

<p><strong>Thank you so much</strong> to Joey, Brad and Anuj for being part of this panel!  So often, when one is making a presentation like this, and you're talking about new products &amp; features, it gets a bit to marketing/salesey and not just the brass-tacks &amp; practical discussion that we were able to have here.  </p>



<p>Please <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thaddeusreeves/">hit me up on LinkedIn</a> if you have any other questions stemming from this that you'd like to ask!</p>
