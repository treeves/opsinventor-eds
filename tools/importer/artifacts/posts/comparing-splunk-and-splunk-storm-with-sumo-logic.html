Seeing that log file analysis has long been my favorite product category of any of the enterprise software I run (chalk that up to my days long ago as a support engineer for <u><a href="http://blogs.webtrends.com/2013/02/what-should-you-expect-from-a-testing-tool/">Webtrends</a></u>), I’m of course interested in the differences between <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/02/26/diving-into-the-new-splunk-app-framework/">Splunk</a> (as the preeminent do-it-yourself solution) and other newer products like Splunk’s own <em>Splunk Storm</em> hosted solution, and up-and-coming competition like <a href="http://www.sumologic.com/blog/company/the-truth-is-in-the-logs">Sumo Logic</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>Following are a few points that I can think of, from my own usage of the product, that compares the three.&#160; Note that the Splunk install I have is a relatively small one – 40GB/Day data ingestion rate, so the problems I have and features I like are going to be a lot different than ones of a big site.</p>  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="600"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top" width="150">&nbsp;</td>        <td valign="top" width="150"><strong>Splunk (Self Hosted)</strong></td>        <td valign="top" width="150"><strong>Splunk Storm</strong></td>        <td valign="top" width="150"><strong>Sumo Logic</strong></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="150"><b>Auto Source Typing</b></td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Knows the source typing of your data, automatically parses it and extracts fields.&#160;&#160; Nearly every log file type except the really obscure ones (like CQ5 dual-line request logs) are automatically parsed &amp; fields extracted by Splunk.&#160; </td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Same as self-hosted Splunk. </td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Can’t parse data by itself, makes you tell it how to parse the data before it can extract any fields.&#160; The Sumologic demo guy we had said this is coming later as a feature at some point. </td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="150"><b>Interactive field extraction</b></td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Easy as heck to extract fields from unknown log types using the interactive field extractor tool.&#160; Makes it dead easy to do more complicated lookups &amp; averages on new log types.&#160; </td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Same as self-hosted Splunk</td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Couldn’t figure out how to do this with Sumo. </td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="150"><b>Scripted Input from&#160; Unix Boxes</b></td>        <td valign="top" width="150">This is (in my opinion) one of the biggest selling features of Splunk.&#160; Splunk’s *NIX app includes, out of the box, nifty scripted input that grabs the output of top, ps, netstat, df, etc and dumps that into a parsable, graphable index that you can use to make nifty CPU and network graphs for dashboards, search to see when a particular process was actually running on a machine, etc.&#160; </td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Splunk Storm presently does NOT allow you to run apps, which is far and away the biggest reason it’s still sort of a toy compared to the self-host product. </td>        <td valign="top" width="150">You’d have to do this yourself in Sumo Logic, which is a LOT of work.&#160; </td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="150"><b>App ecosystem</b></td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Self-host Splunk gives you access to all of the nifty apps folks have made for parsing F5 data, Nagios data, S3 buckets, etc, etc.&#160; </td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Splunk Storm doesn’t let you do apps.&#160; <img style="border-style:none;" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" alt="Sad smile" src="http://www.jetteroheller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wlemoticon-sadsmile.png" /></td>        <td valign="top" width="150">They’re working on an app infrastructure, but this is nowhere compared to the 5-year head start Splunk has. </td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="150"><b>Graphing</b></td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Splunk has sexy graphing libraries that let you make radial gages, marker gages, area graphs, scatter graphs, all sorts of sexy ways to visualize data.&#160; </td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Same as self-host Splunk. </td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Bar graphs, line graphs, that’s about it.&#160; Pretty bare-bones, though the dashboarding is pretty easy to accomplish.</td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="150"><strong>Integration with On-Premise Data</strong></td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Single web search head can query multiple indexers, including things on F5’s, CCTV prod, etc, etc.&#160; A search head at amazon could transparently include on-site data.</td>        <td valign="top" width="150">You can’t really do this with Storm. </td>        <td valign="top" width="150">Can’t do this with Sumo.</td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="150"><strong>Data Retention</strong></td>        <td valign="top" width="150">You can retain as much as you have storage for.&#160; </td>        <td valign="top" width="150">You pay for data retention</td>        <td valign="top" width="150">You pay for data retention</td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>There’s more, but this is just what I could think of off the top of my head. </p>  <p>I’m <strong>really </strong>curious to know what folks think of Sumo Logic, especially for those who’ve used Splunk in production as well.&#160;
