      <p>In my last post, I was attempting to insert two videos into my post from <a href="http://www.twth.org/">the Way to Happiness</a> website. However, I was thwarted by the built-in filter that Wordpress has on &lt;embed&gt; tags.&nbsp; So, the videos were stripped.&nbsp; </p> <p>They posted just fine <a href="http://fastpagemode.blogspot.com/2007/11/enhance-my-download-experience-another.html">to my Blogger blog</a>, however. </p> <p>Anyone know of a way around this?&nbsp; I know there are custom wordpress tags for YouTube videos, specifically, but not just for plain-old &lt;embed&gt; type videos, which are strewn over all sorts of other video-sharing sites on the net. </p>
