<p class="flickr-yourcomment"> 	A whole <a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/">Scientology VM</a> team is already on the ground in Blacksburg to help the grief-stricken students and faculty after Monday's shooting.  Many more are needed, however.</p>
A team of 25 VMs are at the University. Another 15 to 20 are about to leave to join them. But 100 VMs are needed on the ground within the next 24 hours.

This tragedy has overwhelmed the students and faculty of the school and the local residents. And the families of the victims are in urgent need of our help.

Scientology VM's have been asked by the Salvation Army staff, who are manning the official relief center on campus, to provide 24-hour help for the next two days in the form of grief counseling and trauma relief for the parents and families of the victims.

To meet the need and demand for our help 100 VMs are needed immediately. If you can help, call Abby in NY at (212) 757-9615 or cell (646) 235-9994 or <a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/contact/form/contact.html?filter=(%26(|(o=dcd)))">Kayleen in DC</a> at (202)797-9826. You can also call the <a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/contact/form/contact.html?filter=(%26(|(o=dcd)))">DC Scientology VM Hotline</a> at 1-800-435-7498.
