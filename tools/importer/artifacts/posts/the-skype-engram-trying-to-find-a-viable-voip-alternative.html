      I have never tried so hard to get people to take my money.

As any one of the few thousand people who saw my <a href="http://jetteroheller.wordpress.com/2007/08/16/skype-is-down-what-else-is-there/">post about Skype alternatives</a> would have seen, I think I chose the wrong time to pick up VoIP.&nbsp; <a href="http://heartbeat.skype.com/2007/08/the_words_weve_all_been_waitin.html">Skype being down</a> only contributed to my VoIP engram [as in <a href="http://bpi.goldenageofknowledge.net/items/dmsmh_oak.html?view=detail">Dianetics</a>], which is still happening.

I started with a simple problem - I have 50 people that I'm looking to set up on VoIP clients, so they can make long-distance calls.&nbsp; My main requirement is to get it so I can manage all of them centrally, add money to their accounts, and just let them have at it. 

I started with Skype, and after the <a href="http://heartbeat.skype.com/2007/08/looking_slightly_better_at_070.html">login was finally working</a>, I fired up everyone with accounts, loaded up some cashola, and was up and away.&nbsp; Then, I ran into the big wall - in that I could only put a max of $30 on the account, and under no circumstances could I add any more.&nbsp; That in addition to <span style="font-weight:bold;">extreme</span> lags in logon speed, I finally ended up exhausting my $30 in a matter of hours, and my people were without telecommunications.&nbsp; If you know anything of <a href="http://bpi.goldenageofknowledge.net/items/dn55_unif.html?view=detail">Scientology and the Communication formula</a>, that's called a break in communication.&nbsp; 

So, luckily, I had helpful neighbourhood blog commenters, who pointed me at <a href="http://voipstunt.com">VoIPStunt</a>.&nbsp; However, much to my dismay, the payment woes were the same, and after $30, I was SOL once again.&nbsp; Unlike Skype, they had 1.3 billion different ways to pay, but unless I wanted to set up each individual user by paying with a totally separate credit card, and then having absolutely no central administration means. 

So, after saying 'argh' a number of times, I struck out trying to find some other way of doing it.&nbsp; My <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH1_3.HTM">misunderstood words</a> in VoIP abound, but I flung myself into understanding the do-it-yourselfer approach anyway.&nbsp; I went into SIP and H.323 and all of the different ways of doing NAT with the reverse-static-snow-cone NAT and whatever, trying to figure out how to punch UDP through the firewall and blah blah blah.&nbsp; It's a nightmare, and I still can't figure it out. 

Anyone have any great suggestions?&nbsp; It seems like such a simple problem -- to just be able to centrally manage 50 people doing VOIP, and for someone to just take my money so I can fire it up.&nbsp;
