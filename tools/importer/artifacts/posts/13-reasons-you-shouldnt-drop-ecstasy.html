      <p><a href="http://www.drugfreeworld.org/" target="_new"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="240" src="http://www.jetteroheller.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/windowslivewriter13reasonsyoushouldntdropecstasy-1181image051.png" width="223" align="right" border="0"></a>You would think that the average person wouldn't need <em>more</em> reasons to stay away from Ecstasy.&nbsp; However, unfortunately for all of us, we do. </p> <p>It's come up repeatedly in surveys done by the <a href="http://www.scientologytoday.org/">Church of Scientology</a> and others, that one of the major reasons why people get in to drugs in the first place is lack of data on what drugs are and what they actually do to you. </p> <p>As a quote from the <a href="http://www.drugfreeworld.org/factsaboutdrugs/joints.html">marijuana</a> section of this new site from the <a href="http://www.drugfreeworld.org/">Foundation for a Drug-Free World</a>: </p> <p><strong><font color="#008080"><em>Because a tolerance builds up, marijuana can lead users to consume stronger drugs to achieve the same high. When the effects start to wear off, the person may turn to more potent drugs to rid himself of the unwanted conditions that prompted him to take marijuana in the first place. </em></font></strong></p> <p><strong><font color="#008080"><em>Marijuana itself does not lead the person to the other drugs: people take drugs to get rid of unwanted situations or feelings. The drug (marijuana) masks the problem for a time (while the user is high). When the "high" fades, the problem, unwanted condition or situation returns more intensely than before. The user may then turn to stronger drugs since marijuana no longer “works.”</em></font></strong> <p>However, if you read down posts in Digg, you'll unfortunately find a high number of people (possibly already drug users themselves) which will go to no end to extoll the benefits of marijuana and why people are 'dumb' to oppose legalization of this drug.&nbsp; Similarly, ecstasy is commonly pawned off as a 'fun party drug' and a 'sex enhancer' when it has completely disastrous effects. </p> <p>I just posted a story regarding such on Digg, and the first two comments I got on the story were pro-marijuana.&nbsp; So there's definitely a lack of education here on the effects -- both short and long-term -- that marijuana can have, and does have. </p> <p>Never mind something more serious like ecstasy.&nbsp; </p> <p>I just read the booklet <em><a title="ecstasy" href="http://www.drugfreeworld.org/factsaboutdrugs/ecstasy.html">The Truth About Ecstasy</a></em>, which is available on the site as a part of their <a href="http://www.drugfreeworld.org/about/reallifedruged.html">drug education kit</a> that they get donated to schools and such.&nbsp; It's factually horrifying what&nbsp;this drug can do to a person.&nbsp; </p> <p>Anyhow, rather than explain, I would hope&nbsp;you'd check this out for yourself.&nbsp; The whole point, really, is to educate people before they start on&nbsp;drugs -- not after they're already destroyed by them.&nbsp; So, of course, the name of the&nbsp;game is to get this to as many people as possible. &nbsp; </p>
