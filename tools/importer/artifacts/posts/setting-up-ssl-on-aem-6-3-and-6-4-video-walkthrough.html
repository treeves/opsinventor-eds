      To complement the article I wrote earlier on <a href="http://www.jetteroheller.com/implementing-ssl-on-aem/">Implementing SSL on AEM</a>, I decided to do a video walk-through &amp; slideshare on how to set up SSL on AEM 6.3/6.4.

I also set this up as I am considering putting together a training course on Adobe Experience Manager administration, and wanted to see what a lesson on such would look &amp; feel like.  I'm absolutely welcome to any suggestions, as it's been years since I've taught a class!

And in the case you want to step through anything in the video above, the slideshare for the video is below.
