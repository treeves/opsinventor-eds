      I originally grabbed this blog to see if I could get the Netscape Widget I saw on Netscape.com to work. However, due to the fact I haven't gotten around to that yet, I'll just do a good old "first salvo" post

I named this one for <a href="http://www.kaboodle.com/jetteroheller">Jettero Heller</a>, famed star of <a href="http://lron.hubbard.org">L. Ron Hubbard</a>'s best-selling <i>Mission Earth</i> dekology, probably my favourite set of science fiction books in existence. Jettero was sent to earth to engineer a way out of Earth destroying itself -- something I think that with some intelligence and the right technology, could be done here as well.

In real life, I'm a network engineer and a <a href="https://www.scientologyparent.com/">Scientologist</a>, currently living in L.A.
