      Flame suits ready.

Probably the first rule that anyone learns in sales is, "don't knock the competition."  Probably even more fundamental is to not knock your friends.

[digg=http://www.digg.com/linux_unix/Save_a_penguin_Unplug_a_Linux_Server_Today]I just got an e-mail from <a href="http://www.events-at-sun.com/save-a-penguin/">Sun</a> which is probably the largest violation of <a href="http://www.volunteerministers.org/store/pubs/fundamentals-of-public-relations.html" title="Scientology Survey Tech">L. Ron Hubbard's Survey tech</a> that I've ever seen.  It was an e-mail with the title of, "<strong>Save a Penguin - Unplug a Linux Server Today</strong>".  The e-mail was fairly good-natured, with a headline paragraph stating,
<blockquote>Linux x86-based servers have enjoyed success in the Web tier by delivering UNIX capabilities in a low-cost, open-source platform. However, power-hungry commodity Linux servers are driving up costs as companies continue to build-out Web tier infrastructures horizontally. Yesterday's cost-cutting solutions, inexpensive servers, are today's resource wasters. High-growth Linux Web infrastructures are <strong>inefficient</strong>, <strong>costly</strong>, and <strong>difficult to manage</strong>.</blockquote>
Now, noting the average demographic who is a Linux/Sun SysAdmin, knocking Microsoft may be acceptable, even lauded.  Cracking a funny joke about retiring a tired old NT server in favor of a nice, spiffy new Solaris or Linux box running Sun hardware would definitely slide right in there.  But knocking Linux in a Sun ad?

I, personally, have several Sun Aquarius-class servers (x2100, x2200), all of which are running Linux.  I tried running Solaris, thought it would be cool, but was unable to find a SINGLE worthwhile Solaris book I could use to bone up on the OS.  The entire command structure of Solaris differs slightly from my more familiar FC6, so I found myself going nuts just trying to turn on a network interface.  So, I said to heck with it, and decided to just run FC6 Xen on all of them until Sun could get me a nice Solaris book that equalled the many O'Reilly books I had which handily <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/CHAPTER1.HTM" title="Scientology Study Tech">clear my misunderstood words</a> on Linux.

So, I'm right now a happy Sun customer who loves Linux.  So, I'm not <em>totally</em> the right guy to attempt to alienate from Linux by extolling the benefits of Solaris.

L. Ron Hubbard put it beautifully in a Scientology essay he wrote on the subject of manners, stating:

<strong>"'Good manners' sum up to (a) granting importance to the other person, and (b) using the <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH5_3.HTM" title="Communication">two-way communication cycle</a> (as in </strong><em><a href="http://www.smi.org/route/page41.htm">Dianetics 55!)</a>.  <strong>Whatever motions or rituals are, these two factors are involved.  Thus, a PR violating them will find himself and his program rejected.</strong></em>

<em><strong>"Arrogance and force may win domination and control, but will never win acceptance and respect."  - <a href="http://www.lronhubbard.org">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, Essay entitled <em>Manners</em>. </strong></em>

More effective, I think, would have been to play off the fact that Solaris is, from all I've experienced, a buffer, more hardcore and battle tested OS that has strengths that build on what people already like about Linux.  As opposed to a "ditch linux!" campaign, smarter might be to validate people who are already running Linux, and then let them know Solaris builds on this with some damn-cool features that Linux enthusiasts already dig.
