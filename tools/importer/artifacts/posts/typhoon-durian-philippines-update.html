      <p>This from the ACT site (www.act-intl.org):</p>

<br>
<p>Following the wrath of Typhoon Durian, which lashed the Philippines on
30 November, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has declared a state of
emergency. The death toll is likely to exceed 1,000, with many of the
casualties in the severely affected barangays in Albay Province, which
were crushed by boulders and mud loosened from the slopes of Mayon
Volcano by the heavy rains.
</p>

<p>Five days after the onslaught of Durian the statistics on the
extent of the devastation are not known as some areas remain isolated
and power and communication lines are still down. <br>
</p>

<p>ACT member the National Council of Churches in the Philippines
(NCCP) reports that to date a total of 93,582 families or 455,593
persons in 694 barangays of the 67 municipalities and 6 cities in 11
provinces of Regions IV-A, IV-B and V have been affected. Of these,
5,612 families or 29,790 individuals have fled to 190 designated
evacuation centers. The Bicol Region (Region V) suffered the most
destruction and the highest number of casualties. <br>
</p>

<p>The National Disaster Co-ordinating Council (NDCC) in its
latest report said that the death toll had reached 450 with 599 missing
and feared dead. Around 66,191 houses have been totally destroyed (this
figure excludes houses totally buried under mudflows). Among the areas
most severely affected areas by mudflows, volcanic debris and solid
volcanic rocks are the municipalities of Sto. Domingo, Daraga,
Guinobatan and Camalig and the city of Legaspi. <br>
</p>

<p>Rescue and retrieval operations are fully underway with workers
from Southern Leyte, the Philippine Air Force, members of the Spanish
Government Rescue team as well as mine workers working round the clock
to recover survivors buried under the debris.
The Department of Social Welfare and Development has issued an
urgent appeal for help. The most urgently needed items are: food, water
purifiers, water containers, mosquito nets, blankets and sleeping mats,
clothing, cooking utensils, medicine and hygiene items.
The NCC, through its relief arm in the Bicol region - the NCCP
Andurog Mayon - will step up its relief operations. <br>
</p>

<p>Volunteers are on
the ground conducting damage assessments and assisting in rescue
operations. Stockpiles from the national warehouse as well as donations
received will be sent to the NCCP Andurog Mayon Operations Center in
Legaspi City for immediate distribution to the evacuation centers.
National staff will also assist the volunteers of Andurog Mayon in the
damage and needs assessment and relief operations.</p>
