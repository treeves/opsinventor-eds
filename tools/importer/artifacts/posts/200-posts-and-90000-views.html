      I just happened to look, and my <a href="http://jetteroheller.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/new-free-scientology-on-line-courses/">last post</a> on the new <a href="http://course.volunteerministers.org/">Scientology Volunteer Ministers Courses</a> was my 200th post on this Wordpress blog, and took me over the 90,000 page view mark as of mid-day today.

Well, that's not so bad, I guess, from something that occupies about 30 mins of my time each week.  Shows you how powerful a tool these great blogging engines like WordPress are.

Though I am no <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> or <a href="http://www.debbieweil.com/blog">Debbie Weil</a>, having a blog that you work away at every so often can teach you more valuable lessons on blog writing &amp; blog management than simply reading one of the aforementioned authors' brilliant missives.

For example:

<strong>Write At Least Every Other Day:</strong>

I have found <strong><em>repeatedly</em></strong> that you can keep your blog's statistics buoyant by simply writing an article every other day.  Let your blog stay stagnant for a week or so, and you'll come back to find a totally vacant blog that nobody visits.  Write every other day, and you'll find even your crusty old articles getting a ton of traffic all of the sudden.   Various people have their theories on how <a href="http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2004/11/10/increase_visibility_in_blog_and.htm">RSS pinging</a> and the velocity of new inbound links can then up your rankings on this and that, but when it comes down to empirical observation -- just writing an interesting post of some sort on some subject, on a regular basis, makes for good &amp; continual traffic.

<strong>When you think it or see it, blog it:</strong>

This is something I've been ever-glad to tools like <strong>Flock</strong> and Microsoft Live Writer for, is it makes "impulse blogging" much easier to do. Example:  I was debugging a friend's 3DS Max computer and found major problems in getting 3D Studio Max to work on Windows Vista.   So, I wrote like a single-paragraph blog post on it.  Must have been timely, as that one post on getting <a href="http://jetteroheller.wordpress.com/2007/03/09/3ds-max-9-on-windows-vista/">3DS Max to work on Vista</a> ended up getting around 30,000 page views right after posting, due to showing up #1 when people <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=3ds+max+vista&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">Google for "3ds Max Vista"</a>.   Other posts have met with similar interesting side-effects, including random listings on the front-page of LinuxWorld or being #1 on a particularly good set of Sphere back-links -- none of which I could have predicted before doing the blog post.

After one of my last doozies, I wrote a little post on <a href="http://jetteroheller.wordpress.com/2007/05/06/how-to-drive-traffic-with-web-20-apps/">driving traffic to a site with Web 2.0 tools</a>, something that could definitely stand an update.

Interested, though, in some feedback on what others have found effective in making a blog productive for you!
