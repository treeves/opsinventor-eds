Soul great ISAAC HAYES didn't leave hit TV series SOUTH PARK because
they mocked his religion of <a href="http://www.scientology.org.uk">Scientology</a> - insisting it was simply
because he wasn't enjoying the show anymore.<br>

The 63-year-old soul singer, who voiced the popular character CHEF on
the show, had a falling out with creators MATT STONE and TREY PARKER
after they featured an episode mocking prominent Scientologist TOM
CRUISE and JOHN TRAVOLTA last year (05).<br>

However, Hayes says the reason he ultimately moved on had nothing to do
with the episode saying, "I just decided it was time to leave. For a
time it was fun. The fun ran out."<br>
