I had my first trip to China this April for the Canton Fair, and in doing so got to sample nearly all of Guangzhou's copious and very modern modes of transportation to get around the city.

Being a general train enthusiast and also generally averse to taxi cabs, I leaned toward public transit in getting to where I needed to go in Guanzhou - getting back and forth from my hotel to the sprawling Canton Fair complex, and then also to go visit various business partners in the general area.
