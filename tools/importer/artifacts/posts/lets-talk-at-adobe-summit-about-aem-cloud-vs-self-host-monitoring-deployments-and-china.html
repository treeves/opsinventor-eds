<p>Adobe Summit (March 15-17, 2022) is rapidly approaching! Given that one of the most valuable parts of any conference is the INTERACTION with other Adobe employees, partners, implementers and customers, it's fabulous that Adobe has their <em>Braindate</em> format to rub elbows with folks on topics of your choice.  And it's FREE!</p>



<p>This year, I'm going to be hosting a few different topics that I'm quite passionate about, and would love to both shop-talk with other folks with more expertise, but also would love even more to bring folks up to speed if you're new to Adobe Experience Manager and the Adobe space.  </p>



<p>If any of these topics interest you, please join on in!  </p>



<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>all it takes to join any of these Braindates is to <a href="https://summit.adobe.com/na/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://summit.adobe.com/na/">register for Adobe Summit,</a> which is FREE this year.  </p>



<h3><a href="https://adobesummit.braindate.com/topics/79601/">Running AEM in China: Is Cloud an Option? </a>  </h3>



<p>China is a super-complex subject when it comes to hosting, and even more complex when it comes to implementing something like an interconnected cloud service.  What are your options?  <a href="https://adobesummit.braindate.com/topics/79601/">Join this session here.</a></p>



<h3><a href="https://adobesummit.braindate.com/braindates/103386/">Monitoring &amp; Alerting for AEM as a Cloud Service and Adobe Commerce</a></h3>



<p>AEM as a Cloud Service is a new landscape when it comes to alerting, monitoring and log aggregation.  Let's discuss what options you have, the best ways to roll them out, and what gaps still exist.  <a href="https://adobesummit.braindate.com/braindates/103386/">Join this session here</a>.</p>



<h3><a href="https://adobesummit.braindate.com/braindates/103427/">Is there still a case for self-hosted AEM?</a></h3>



<p>Is there indeed?  Should all AEM environments be in the Cloud Service or hosted by Adobe Managed Services?  Are there cases still where it makes sense to have a partner run your AEM, or to run your AEM in-house?  <a href="https://adobesummit.braindate.com/braindates/103427/">Join this session here</a>.</p>



<h3><a href="https://adobesummit.braindate.com/braindates/103385/">Speeding up AEM as a Cloud Service Deployments</a></h3>
