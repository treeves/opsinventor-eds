      <blockquote cite="http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4962">Most business users claim only a fraction of the hard drive space provided for them, especially considering most unique data gets written to a network anyway.  The operating system and applications can all fit in less than 10GB of space, which is well within the sizes of solid-state hard drives today.  Barnetson's group has calculated that during an 8-hour day the average hard drive:    * Has about a 1% chance of failure per year    * Consumes 9W    * Loses about 7 to 15 minutes per day in productivityThe fact that we lose so much time alone due to hard drive spin-ups and seeks is alone appalling, but the decreased power consumption is what is driving solid-state adoption today. A NAND device uses less than 200 milliwatts during read/writes, and 0 watts when not being accessed.  On the desktop this is relatively unimportant, but on a notebook the hard drive accounts for 10% of the total power draw.  Cutting this number down to less than 1% means an extra 12 minutes of usage on my 2 hour battery.</blockquote><p class="citation"><cite><a href="http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4962">DailyTech - Solid-state Drives Ready for Prime Time</a></cite></p>
