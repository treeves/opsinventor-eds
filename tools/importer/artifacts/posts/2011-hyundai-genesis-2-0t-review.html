To change things up, I went to NextCar instead of Enterprise to pick up a rental, and they outfitted me with an older 2011 Hyundai Genesis 2.0T.

It's pretty easy to see why Hyundai is no longer offering the Genesis with the 2.0T, as this engine is easily the weakest link in what otherwise is a decent first effort from Hyundai on making an actual sports car. The 2.0L port-injected turbo makes only 210 horsepower - but the worst part is not just the lack of meaningful thrust, but the fact that it sounds so pathetic while doing it.

Despite having these big dual exhaust tips, the engine's sound is muted and number than a Toyota Corolla. The only fun sounds come from the whistle the turbo makes spooling up, but that grows old pretty quick.

Gas mileage also wasn't so hot, averaging only 27.6mpg on highway-only driving - well lower than the EPA-estimate 30mpg the manufacturer reports.

If I was getting a Genesis, I'd positively opt for the V6.
