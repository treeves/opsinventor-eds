      I've come to a conclusion, based on the number of responses (0) to <a href="http://jetteroheller.wordpress.com/2008/04/12/foreign-seo-translated-titles-snippet-filename-comparison/">various posts I've put up on the subject of International SEO</a>, that Americans don't know jack about the subject, and probably don't have much of a reason (usually) to care. 

I did get some enlightened help on one particular <a href="http://www.highrankings.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=35305">SEO message board</a> I was on, but it didn't look like these people were Americans.&nbsp; Most of my fellow countrymen, by survey, can't find the city of Budapest on a map, and have never heard of places like Dubai and Kuala Lumpur.&nbsp; It's unfortunate, since I'd be willing to wager that just about anyone in Dubai or Kuala Lumpur could point to New York or Los Angeles on a map.&nbsp; 

And they probably speak English, too.&nbsp; Hmph.&nbsp; Figures.&nbsp; Apparently <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2003/11/prweb87278.htm">90% of the Internet</a> is written in English. 

But here's what I'm trying to accomplish with foreign SEO, and perhaps some other enlightened individual can assist.&nbsp; 

(and this is example text only, but is what I'm trying to put together) 

<span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Best Practices:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Encoding:</span>&nbsp; Set to UTF-8 and language set to local iso language code
<span style="font-weight:bold;">HTML Titles:</span>&nbsp; Use foreign chars, UTF-8 encoding, title case
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Meta Keywords:</span> Don't worry about translating these, not used by search engines
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Meta Description:</span> Custom-written SERP-friendly text written and translated
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Page Filename:</span>&nbsp; For Japanese, Chinese, use UTF-8 local chars in links, and decoded ASCII filenames.&nbsp; For Russian, Greek and Hebrew, use whatever is easiest to program.&nbsp; For en_US and western european languages, use ASCII filenames in links and filenames, with transliterated "oe", etc equivalents for accented characters

...or something like this.&nbsp; Some stable guidelines like that. 

Anyone with any bright ideas?<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align:right;color:#CCC;font-size:x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/SEO" rel="tag">SEO</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/search%20engine" rel="tag">search engine</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20multilingual" rel="tag"> multilingual</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20international" rel="tag"> international</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->
