      The shopping cart-tent combo depicted in these images was the winner in a design contest where the goal was to "to design a cart that can provide shelter and storage."  Why?  Well, elsewhere on the site it explains that this was a "social awareness" design contest because "homelessness is a complex issue encompassing multiple facets of society."

This is another one which must have been ripped off of theonion.com or something.  I can't believe this is factually in the design section of Digg!!  Nice article though.  <br><br><a href="http://www.designboom.com/contest/view.php?contest_pk=10&amp;item_pk=6175&amp;p=3">read more</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="http://digg.com/design/Shopping_cart_designed_for_the_homeless">digg story</a>
