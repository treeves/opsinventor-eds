      Just saw this one on <a href="http://www.scientologytoday.org/"><em>ScientologyToday</em></a>:

<em>The next awardee, Gwen Olsen, a former pharmaceutical industry representative, told an expert panel in Washington D.C. last January how she influenced doctors with gifts and presented skillfully manipulated data to get them to prescribe drugs that harmed patients. Her moment of truth came when her 20-year-old niece committed suicide following a withdrawal reaction from the antidepressant Paxil. Ms. Olsen, who has authored the book </em><em>Confessions of an Rx Drug Pusher, is a passionate and outspoken critic, protecting the lives of children and young adults by exposing pharma and psychiatric collusion to defraud the public.</em>

This was from an article on the recent 38th anniversary of the Citizen's Commisison on Human Rights, an organization that will stop at nothing until psychiatry is basically brought back under the law.  This particular woman (whom I've seen a video of -- and she's <em>amazing</em>) had been selling psych drugs for years, and finally saw what it was that she was selling.  She had been being duped by the various drug companies into thinking the drugs were much less harmful than they really were -- and it had to get to a point where someone very close to her died from psych drugs before she saw that they had been lying to her the entire time.

Now she's a <em>driven woman</em> to ensure that psychiatric drug companies are exposed for what and who they are, and that people don't get lulled into believing the story that they're just out to 'help people'.  They're actually intentionally marketing drugs that people don't need, which basically enslave them mentally and physically, so that they can make a profit.

This just goes to show that it's not just <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/">Scientology</a> and <a href="http://www.iasmembership.org/">Scientologists</a> who are against psychiatry -- it's anyone who actually finds out the truth about that operation.
