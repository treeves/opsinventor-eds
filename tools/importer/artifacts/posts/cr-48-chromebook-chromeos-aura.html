I just opened my Chromebook to sit on the couch and do some blogging tonight, and lo and behold - on the Dev Channel, an update was waiting to bring the machine up from ChromeOS 18 straight to ChromeOS 20 - which brought me the Aura UI!

From what <a href="googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/04/dev-channel-update-for-chromebooks.html">I had read earlier regarding the Aura UI</a>, Google was going to skip right past Aura on the CR-48, giving CR-48 users only critical patches &amp; updates.  From what I read, it looked like I was going to have to install Linux on the machine to keep it useful.

So, I was obviously surprised when I saw this tonight!
