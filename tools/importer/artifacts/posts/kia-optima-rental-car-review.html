</i>Well, this is going to be another in what is likely going to be a recurring theme for this blog.  I rent cars at least once a month for a road trip from DC to Knoxville, Tennessee, for business purposes.  Being a car nut, I try to rent a different car every time - and of course, I do end up being fairly opinionated on each.

On once such recent trip, I rented a maroon Kia Optima EX.  Enterprise had originally put me into a Chevy Malibu, but as I needed bluetooth for the long trip (so I can do conference calls &amp; such) and the included OnStar wasn't going to cut it.

The Optima is actually an incredibly capable sedan, and I came away impressed.

<strong>Summary In a Sentence:</strong>

I would own this car in a heartbeat if it came with a 6-speed manual.

Brief driving notes:

<strong>Powertrain &amp; Handling:</strong>

The Optima has a 2.4 liter twincam 4-cylinder making 200hp to the front wheels through a decent 6-speed automatic.  While it's got these big dual-exhausts and such, the engine sort of makes a tinny sound but still is plenty gutsy especially for a base engine.    I did wish for a bit more passing power when on two-lane roads, but in the main, it's a great little engine.   My main beef?  Lack of a manual transmission.  As it doesn't have much in the way of low-end torque, you have to rev it to make it seem quick, and that's laborious and imprecise with the automatic, even in manual-shift mode.

Probably the thing which struck me first about the car was its handling.  It feels athletic when you drive it - especially when driven back to back with the Chevy Malibu.  It has a small-diameter steering wheel, and a nice &amp; direct steering feel, and has grippy seats which I found good for cornering.

And I DID definitely test the cornering, as on my way back from Knoxville I took the car through the infamous Dragon's Tail on Route 129 through the Smokies.  The route has (as advertised) 318 curves in 11 miles and - let me tell you - it does not disappoint.

The Kia, while not the IDEAL vehicle for such an excursion (I'd say ideal would be more of a Subaru BRZ), also was no slouch for a family sedan.  The 215/55 tires held on well, and the manual mode on the transmission (though frustrating) worked OK in lieu of a proper gearbox.

<b>Gas Mileage:</b>

I got <b>25mpg</b> in mixed city/highway driving, and <strong>32.5mpg</strong> on the 500-mile trip from Knoxville to DC.   Not terrible, but also a bit below the EPA estimates.

All told, I'd definitely recommend the Kia Optima to anyone looking for a sedan more on the sporty side, and definitely a comfortable cruiser for the trip down the I-81.
