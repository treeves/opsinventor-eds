My favorite outdoor activity in the world is mountain biking.  However, this past summer, in moving to Portland, Oregon - the "Bike Capital of the USA" - I've basically had to give up mountain biking almost entirely.

It's one of the most bizarre contradictions imaginable about this otherwise fine city, and is one of the most incomprehensible things I tell my friends back East when they ask me about the wonders of moving to the Pacific Northwest.

With the city of Portland's 2011 acquisition of the River View Natural Area and subsequent <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/03/portland_sticks_it_to_mountain.html">March 2015 outlawing of mountain biking in the Area's borders</a>, there is now zero single track open to mountain bikers within 40 minutes of the city center.
<h2><strong>The Fact that it's "Portland" Makes it Worse</strong></h2>
Now, this bizarre lack of trail rights wouldn't be so notable if this were Kansas City or Indianapolis or Miami.   But in the Portland area, <strong>bike culture is everywhere</strong>, and views of majestic mountains and forested hillsides are <em>everywhere</em>, serving as a non-stop reminder that trails are out there, beckoning to be ridden.

But the evil joke is, that you have to go nearly all the way to Mt. Hood, a good way up the Columbia River Gorge, or a fair distance out toward the Coast in order to approach any decent riding trails.    For someone like me who lives in Lake Oswego and works in Beaverton, there are zero options for after-work rides.
<h2><strong>Even Washington, DC is better for Mountain Biking</strong></h2>
I moved to Portland last summer from Washington, DC - a notoriously <strong>bad</strong> city for mountain biking.  As so much of the city's park space are National Parks, they (by default) don't allow biking except on paved trails.  However, the city's many other natural spaces offered plenty of ways to get an MTB fix.  I lived adjacent to Wheaton Regional Park in Maryland, a 500-acre park with miles of easygoing trails which allowed me to rapidly introduce my two small children to the beauty of the forest and the joys of just letting it rip on singletrack.   I credit the easy access to bike-friendly dirt with getting my kids both mountain biking by the age of 4.

I found plenty of other options - Pimmett Run Park in Virginia, the Wakefield Mountain Bike park and Cross-County Connector trail through Fairfax County, VA, etc - the metro area was just littered with ways to get yourself onto dirt and go - or even use dirt as a viable avenue for commuting!

And if you were to make a list of the top 50 US cities for mountain biking, DC would probably be like #35 or something.  Never mind <a href="http://www.singletracks.com/blog/mtb-trails/top-10-mountain-bike-cities-in-north-america/">these 10 cities which actually are GOOD for mountain biking</a>, unlike our fair town.
<h2><strong>By Ostracizing Mountain Bikers, You're Cutting  Off Our Parks' Most Active Advocates</strong></h2>
Due to the fact that mountain bikers, by and large, <strong>know</strong> that they have to work hard to acquire and retain access to good trails, they end up as the most active and <strong>involved</strong> advocates I've ever seen for proper trail usage, maintenance, and community volunteerism.

Case in point - my last job had me traveling regularly to Knoxville, Tennessee - a metro area about a third of the size of Portland, nestled against the Great Smoky Mountains in Eastern Tennessee.   Within a 15 minute drive of my company's HQ were <strong>three separate high-quality mountain bike parks</strong>, (Concord, Ijams and Haw Ridge) each of them well-marked and extremely well-maintained by community volunteers.

&nbsp;

One of them, <a href="http://www.outdoorknoxville.com/places/trails/south/ijams-nature-center-trails">Ijams Nature Park</a>, is right across the river from downtown Knoxville, 5 minutes from the city center.   A 300-acre park reclaimed from what was earlier a marble quarry, Ijams has over 40 miles of multi-use trails, and an epic 12-mile mountain bike loop which is far and away the best after-work ride I've ever had.

And weekdays, the parking lots of each of these parks were packed with riders, out appreciating the woods.

And <strong>that is the entire point</strong>.  Nearly every last one of the people I worked with would ride or run the trails of these parks regularly.  But more importantly, each would also routinely <a href="http://ambc-sorba.org/trails/">volunteer their time</a> on weekends or on corporate volunteerism days to get out into the woods and do trail maintenance, signage upgrades, build bridges and berms, repair stream crossings, and otherwise make the trails beautiful, usable and sustainable ways for people to enjoy the outdoors.

Which is precisely why I'm baffled at Portland's steady campaign to ostracize mountain bikers - a group that I'd say is arguably the most active resource they could have in terms of volunteer labor for creating and maintaining trails.
<h2><strong>If you Want a Park Protected, Get People to Use It</strong></h2>

The genius of our country's National Parks system lies in the fact that the most vocal and active protectors of a natural area are those folks who actually USE it.   If our lovely city really does care about our great tracts of natural spaces, let them be used by those groups most passionate about keeping them open and natural.

The one of the biggest reasons that I've spent so much time with my kids out on trail, is that I want them to grow up with an appreciation and therefore a <strong>responsibility</strong> for our beautiful forested areas.   You can't expect anyone to be responsible for something they can't touch.

I hope the city of Portland <a href="http://bikeportland.org/2015/03/16/riders-rally-river-view-urge-city-reverse-biking-ban-135674">gets the point</a> - if you're really are serious about protecting our natural spaces, don't alienate what could be your biggest ally.
