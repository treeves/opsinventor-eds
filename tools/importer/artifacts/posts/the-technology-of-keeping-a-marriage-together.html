<p class="flickr-yourcomment">[digg=http://www.digg.com/offbeat_news/The_Technology_of_Keeping_a_Marriage_Together/]If you've read any other post I've done, you can tell I'm a bit of a geek.  I like playing soccer, I like mountain biking, but above these things l like technology.   However, one thing that many people don't know is that there is a technology for <a href="http://www.smi.org/route/page20.htm">keeping a marriage together</a>.</p>
This is one thing that was a complete breakthrough that <a href="http://www.lronhubbard.org/">L. Ron Hubbard</a> made in <a href="http://www.scientologytoday.org/">Scientology</a>, in that marriages aren't actually just hit-or-miss affairs where you either make it or you don't.  There are exact, specific things that one can do to keep a marriage together, and fix it up when it looks utterly hopeless.

Just so I don't leave you in utter mystery, the principle secret of marriage comes under the heading of communication.  There is a technology for <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH13_2.HTM">communication in marriage</a>, and it has everything to do with whether a marriage stays together or not.  It's a matter of what do you tell your spouse, and what do you decide she "doesn't need to know".

Media pundits which spout off these dorky data like, "after 3 years, married couples lose interest in each other" and things like this -- it's actually bull. If you know the basic technology of having a marriage (which is available in easy courses you can take at any <a href="http://www/volunteerministers.org/contact/">Church of Scientology</a>), you can actually keep a kickass marriage going indefinitely.

I only say this, as posting this particular Flickr image reminded me of the fact that I'm married for 7 years now, and I'm about 20 times more in love with my wife now than I was when we were married.  So there, take <em>that,</em> media pundits.
