      Talk to any Internet guy, and he'll be able to tell you all about all kinds of ways to communicate.  There's telephone and e-mail and websites and instant messaging and skype, pagers, Blackberries and all manner of other devices.  Oh yes, and there's talking to someone too.

However, the brushed-off portion of this, usually, is not the physical means of <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH3_3.HTM">communication</a> but the actual content of the communication or the lack thereof.  How many people actually know the technology of communication?  It has a precise technology and anatomy, and just like you wouldn't have a cell phone call without a battery in the phone, you don't have an actual communication unless you have all the parts of it there.

The anatomy of communication was very thoroughly worked out in <a href="http://www.rtc.org/en_US/presentations/thisisscientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> by <a href="http://lron.hubbard.org">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, and is something which anyone can learn.  There isn't anyone, at any strata of life (executive or street sweeper) which can't benefit by a proper use of communication.

Get the basics on the following pages, and then stop in at a <a href="http://www.scientologyreligion.org/pg006.html">Church of Scientology</a> and take a course.  It won't take you more than a few days, but you'll be glad you did it.  Just talk to anyone that has.
