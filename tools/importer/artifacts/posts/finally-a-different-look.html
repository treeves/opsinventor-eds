      <p>After nearly a year using the old <i>Regulus</i> theme, I finally decided to take the plung and try out something new with my JetteroHeller blog.  It's odd - I've always been the sort of fellow who switches his Windows color scheme a million times, or is always trying out the newest GTK+ or <a href="http://gnome-look.org/">Compiz themes</a> on my Linux desktop.  Surprising even to me that this is the first time I've ventured to change the look of my blog.  <br>
</p>

<p>Well, let  me know if you like it.   I just got a picture of the Church of <a href="http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/index.html">Scientology</a> they're making in Venezuela - a new <a href="http://orgsaroundtheworld.wordpress.com/2007/06/12/new-ideal-scientology-church-for-valencia-venezuela/">Ideal Org for Valencia</a>.  Figured it showed what I'm trying to communicate in my blog anyhow - that people are making new things, and that this is a new world now where people can actually do something about what they want to change. <br>
