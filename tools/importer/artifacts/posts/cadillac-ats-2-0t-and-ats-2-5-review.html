I'd been looking forward to driving the Cadillac ATS for a long time, and fate finally handed the keys to one for me, when the BMW X5 xDrive35i I rented broke down, and the "only thing they had available" was a jet-black ATS 2.0T.

I've read so many reviews of the ATS vs others in the 3-series-fighter category, that I had a bunch that I wanted to see for myself.    Is it as engaging to drive as folks say?  Does CUE really <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2013-cadillac-ats-25l-test-review">suck that much</a>?   Is the engine of the ATS 2.5 really that awful - I mean, it has 201hp right?
