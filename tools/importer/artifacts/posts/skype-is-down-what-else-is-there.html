      I finally had the neccessity today to set up a little bit of VoIP action, so decided to try out a few stations running Skype.&nbsp; Worked great when I fired it up yesterday, along with the 5.1 million other users which were reportedly up using Skype last night.&nbsp; 

However, there appears to have been some manner of <a href="http://heartbeat.skype.com/2007/08/problems_with_skype_login.html">catastrophic failure at Skype</a>,  resulting in my not being able to log back in all morning, and not even being able to download the Windows software all day today.&nbsp; I finally was able to log in, and my handy Linux Skype client says I'm one of only 74,000 other people who have managed to log in.&nbsp; 

Whoa. 

So, as you can imagine, I'm trying to find alternatives to Skype.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Looking now at MSN Messenger and Yahoo.&nbsp; Anyone have any other ideas?
