Snapped this image while riding the VTA light rail train in to the <a href="http://jetteroheller.wordpress.com/tag/velocity">Velocity Conference</a> this morning. I feel like it captures a lot of what's unique to me about San Jose. It has such an absurd concentration of high-tech companies here that I've spent my life working with, but yet it still never really hides from the fact that it was all recently put here, and was until recently a bunch of farmland.
