      <p>This is garbage!!</p>

<p>Once again, MSN out-does itself for pharmaceutical-supported, paid advertising in the guise of a technical "article" on the subject of anti-depressants.  OK - how about this glorious quote: <i><br>
</i></p>

<p><strong><i>"A study from Finland adds a new twist to the argument that certain antidepressants raise users' suicide risk.</i></strong></p>

<p><strong><i>The
researchers found that while drugs called selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) -- which include Celexa, Paxil, Prozac and Zoloft --
do increase the risk of suicide attempts, they actually lessened
patients' risk of dying by suicide.</i></strong></p>

<p><strong><i>One expert agreed that there is a big difference between attempted suicide and actual suicide."</i></strong></p>

<p>Okay -- so now they are admitting that anti-depressents make you want to crawl out of your skin and try to commit suicide, but people who do so are mostly unsuccessful? <br>
</p>

<p>The whole article is <a href="http://health.msn.com/centers/depression/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100149612&amp;GT1=8866&amp;wa=wsignin1.0">here.</a> <br>
</p>

<p>Once again - I have much less a problem of a pharmaceutical giant spewing forth marketing copy in a bald-faced-lying advertisement, than I do with an article purporting to be a normal scientific article, just continuing to make illogical claims to lull people into taking medication for something that will make them into a drug addict. <br>
</p>

<p>If you think I over-react, perhaps you haven't seen the thorough documentation I have, and you need a <a href="https://www.cchr.org/store/product_info.php?cPath=21&amp;products_id=29">Psychiatry: An Industry of Death DVD</a>.   <br>
