      I just read this on <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/">AnandTech.com</a> and think it's outrageous.  How do I get one of these for my servers?!

<img src="http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/tradeshows/2007/ces/key1/sandisk.jpg" />One of the most impressive product demonstrations we witnessed was a comparison between two identically prepared Dell notebooks except for the drive option. One <span class="iAs">notebook</span> contained a standard 2.5" disk drive while the other one featured the
<span class="content"></span>

<span class="content"> new SanDisk SSD UTAT 5000 1.8" drive with a 32GB capacity. This fifth generation drive features a sustained read rate of 62 megabytes (MB) per second and a random read rate of 7,000 inputs/outputs per second (IOPS) for a 512-byte transfer - up to 100 times faster than most notebook hard disk drives. It also can achieve an average file access rate of 0.12 milliseconds, compared with 19 milliseconds for a typical <span class="iAs">laptop PC</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>hard disk drive. The SanDisk SSD features an extremely low power
consumption rate compared to the laptop hard disk drive: 0.4 watt during active operation versus 1.0 watt which could mean up to 22 minutes or more of additional battery life depending upon usage patterns. </span>

In a demonstration that featured <span class="iAs">Windows Vista</span> Enterprise edition on each notebook we noticed the SSD equipped system
shutdown about <span style="font-weight:bold;">95 seconds faster</span> with four Office applications open at power down . This same configuration booted into Vista and opened the same four Office applications about <span style="font-weight:bold;">115 seconds faster</span>. When resuming from hibernation mode the SSD system took<span style="font-weight:bold;"> less than five seconds</span> while the hard disk system took close to <span style="font-weight:bold;">forty seconds</span> before it was fully functional.

We expect to see these drives to start appearing in OEM systems by the end of Q1 with a price premium around $500 at this time for the 32GB drive. By the end of the year we should expect prices to fall about 40% while drive capacities will increase to 64GB in Q3 and 128GB in Q4. This is a very exciting technology and we should have review samples in the near future.
