A <a href="http://spiritualbeing.wordpress.com/">Scientologist blogger friend of mine</a> just reminded me of <a href="http://www.blogactionday.com/faqs">Blog Action Day</a>, where everyone's going to bring up the same thing at the same time on their blogs.&nbsp; Well, anyone who knows the <a href="http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH3_3.HTM">ARC triangle</a> will know that one will communicate about things that are most real to them, and what's most real to me - in terms of Environmental catastrophes in the making that have impacted me personally - is the complete denuding of our country's forests.&nbsp; 

When I first moved to Oregon, I was absolutely astounded by (a) the sheer beauty of the tall, evergreen forests, and (b) the audacity that some paper companies have to just completely denude a just whole square miles of forestland.&nbsp; 

I know that there are responsible ways to do this, but one that impacted me quite personally was a scene very close to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/william/5850643/">Flickr photo above of Willamina, Oregon</a>.&nbsp; About&nbsp; 3 square miles of land there I had as basically my own personal mountain-biking country, where I had personally made all sorts of great singletracking trails through the beautiful wilderness.&nbsp; Then, one day, the trucks arrived, and within about 3 days the entire area was flattened and not a single trace was left of the forest I had spent years carving through on my bike.&nbsp; 

I know that selective cutting is probably a billion times more expensive, but seriously.&nbsp; 

That's one reason I spend my life promoting on the Internet - to save a few singletracking trails.
