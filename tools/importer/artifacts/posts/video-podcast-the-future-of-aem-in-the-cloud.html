<p>I recently cut the video podcast below (my first one ever!) with my friends <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericvangeem/">Eric </a>and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederickfaulkneriv/">Fred </a>from ICF Next on the future of AEM in the cloud, and what you should think about before making the big plunge into either investing more into your on-premise or self-hosted AEM infrastructure, or moving your AEM workloads to a managed AEM service like AEM as a Cloud Service.</p>

<p>As discussed in some of my <a href="http://www.jetteroheller.com/introducing-aem-as-a-cloud-service/">other posts on AEM as a Cloud Service</a>, this is a pivotal time in marketing website infrastructure and project planning.&nbsp; For the first time, it's <em>technically possible</em> (though maybe or maybe not <em>recommended</em>) to have an enterprise-grade experience management platform running your site <strong>entirely in a managed cloud services</strong>.&nbsp; There are a lot of important things to know about whether or not your Adobe-powered internet properties should move to cloud services, and it's not a black-and-white proposition at all.</p>



<p>In this podcast, we discuss:</p>



<ul><li>What AEM as a Cloud Service consists of</li><li>A basic explanation of AEM architecture, explaining the differences between self-managed AEM hosting in the cloud, and <em>AEM as a Cloud Service</em></li><li>Diagrams of both infrastructure paradigms</li><li>What you need to know about Continuous Integration and AEM as a Cloud Service</li><li>How AEM as a Cloud Service affects maintenance and the workload on your DevOps personnel</li><li>How AEM as a Cloud Service makes use of the AEM Desktop App less terrifying for your Sys Admins</li><li>Whether or not you need to be on AEM 6.5 before attempting to migrate to AEM as a Cloud Service</li><li>Limitations and gotchas of running AEM as a Cloud Service, including log aggregation (Splunk, etc) and Application Performance Monitoring (APM).</li></ul>



<p>Please give the video a watch, very interested to know if you have other questions on this subject as Adobe Summit week rolls on!</p>
